# Project Title
All Primes Up to N

This program finds and stores all the primes up to 1,000,000 in a .dat file. It uses the .dat file 
to fill an arraylist with batches of found primes to search against with a number. If a divisor is 
found for the number, the number is not prime, and is not stored in the .dat file.

## Analysis Steps

I started by creating a random access file and an array to store batches in. I added classes with logic to check 
for primeness and print out results.

### Testing

I tested this program at every step possible, it was a very difficult program to code.

## Notes

I encountered only minor problems, however the program takes 10 hours or more to fully complete.
